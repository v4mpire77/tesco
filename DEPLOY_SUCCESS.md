# üöÄ GUARANTEED Working Deployment

## Step 1: Test Locally First
```powershell
# Make sure everything works locally
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe launch_ui.py
```
If this opens and works, you're ready to deploy!

## Step 2: Use Render (Most Reliable for Flask)

### Why Render?
- ‚úÖ Free forever
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly with Flask
- ‚úÖ Automatic SSL
- ‚úÖ Custom domains
- ‚úÖ Easy to use

### Deploy Steps:

1. **Publish to GitHub:**
   ```powershell
   .\publish_github.ps1
   ```

2. **Go to Render:**
   - Visit: https://render.com
   - Sign up with GitHub account
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"

3. **Connect Repository:**
   - Select your tesco-scraper repo
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Configure (EXACT SETTINGS):**
   ```
   Name: tesco-scraper-[your-name]
   Environment: Python 3
   Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
   Start Command: python web_ui.py
   ```

5. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for build
   - Your app will be live!

## Step 3: Alternative - Railway

If Render doesn't work:

1. **Go to Railway:** https://railway.app
2. **Login with GitHub**
3. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Select your repo** - that's it!

## Your Live URLs:
- Render: `https://tesco-scraper-yourname.onrender.com`
- Railway: `https://tesco-scraper-abc123.up.railway.app`

## üîç Troubleshooting:

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check build logs on the platform
2. Make sure requirements.txt includes all packages
3. Verify your GitHub repo is public
4. Try the alternative platform

**If 404 error:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment
- Check the correct URL from your dashboard
- Try refreshing the page

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist:
- [ ] Local app works (`python launch_ui.py`)
- [ ] Code is on GitHub
- [ ] Repository is public
- [ ] Used Render or Railway
- [ ] Waited for build to complete
- [ ] Accessed correct URL from dashboard

Your scraper WILL work online! üéâ
