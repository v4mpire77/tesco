# üö® Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## If you're getting 404 errors, here's how to fix it:

### üîç Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. **Vercel 404 Error**
If you got this error from Vercel, it means the deployment failed or doesn't exist.

**Fix:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Check if your project is listed
3. If not, redeploy using the correct method below

#### 2. **Wrong Deployment Method**
Some platforms don't work well with Flask apps.

**Recommended platforms for your scraper:**

## ‚úÖ **RENDER (Best for Flask Apps)**

1. **First, publish to GitHub:**
   ```powershell
   .\publish_github.ps1
   ```

2. **Then deploy on Render:**
   - Go to https://render.com
   - Sign up/login with GitHub
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Settings:
     - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - **Start Command:** `python web_ui.py`
     - **Environment:** Python 3
   - Click "Create Web Service"

3. **Your app will be live at:**
   `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

## ‚úÖ **RAILWAY (Also Great)**

1. **Publish to GitHub first** (same as above)

2. **Deploy on Railway:**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Login with GitHub
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your tesco-scraper repository
   - Railway auto-detects everything!

3. **Your app will be live at:**
   `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

## ‚ùå **Avoid These for Flask Apps:**
- Vercel (better for Next.js/static sites)
- Netlify (better for static sites)
- GitHub Pages (static only)

## üîß **If Deployment Still Fails:**

1. **Check your files are correct:**
   - `requirements.txt` exists
   - `Procfile` exists
   - `web_ui.py` exists

2. **Check the build logs:**
   - Most platforms show build/deployment logs
   - Look for error messages

3. **Try the local test first:**
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe launch_ui.py
   ```
   If this works, the deployment should work too.

## üéØ **Quick Fix Steps:**

1. **Test locally:** `.\setup.ps1` then `python launch_ui.py`
2. **Publish to GitHub:** `.\publish_github.ps1`
3. **Deploy on Render:** https://render.com
4. **Share your live URL!**

## üìû **Need Help?**
- Check the platform's documentation
- Look at build logs for error messages
- Try a different platform (Render vs Railway)
- Make sure your GitHub repo is public

Your scraper WILL work online - just need the right platform! üöÄ
